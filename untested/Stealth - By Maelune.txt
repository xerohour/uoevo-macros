//Simple stealth trainer. With no armor on you will get to around 60-65 stealth. At this point it is rather controversial on what you need to do. Wiki suggests adding studded leather pieces. Bone armor worked best for me (breastplate, arms, and gloves).
//This macro could be improved by adding some lines to auto-equip
//heavier armors as your stealth gets higher. I'll leave that up to you
//to decide if you'd like to macro it or do it manually
